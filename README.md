# Anthropocene Handbook
A survival guide for organised society (in the event of a nuclear war).

"Prepping" is happening in small pockets all over the world. People with some little money build bunkers and store up foods and other necessities. Billionaires are buying islands for where to flee. This is a works for prepping for the masses, the survivors of nuclear war, which seems increasingly inevitable at this point in time.

A collaborative project, perhaps with plans for a wiki solution, and then print.
